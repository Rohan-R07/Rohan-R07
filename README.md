# 👋 Hi there, I'm Rohan!  

🎯 **Android Developer | Kotlin Enthusiast | UI/UX Design Explorer | Firebase Practitioner**  

I’m an Android developer passionate about building modern, scalable, and aesthetically pleasing apps using the latest Android tech stack. My goal is to combine **clean architecture** with **engaging UI/UX** to craft apps that are not only functional but a joy to use.  

With hands-on experience in **Jetpack Compose**, **MVVM architecture**, and **Firebase services**, I’m constantly pushing myself to integrate more **real-time features, cloud capabilities, and analytics-driven improvements** into my projects.
